# StarWars-App
This is one of my homework from class Advanced Computer Programming I took in my sophomore year.
In this homework, we learned about making animation using onDraw and Thread. However, I "cheated" and used Timer instead of Thread, to allow more flexibility. We also learned about SaveInstanceState and Activity Cycle.

### This app feature:
- Animation inspired by the movie Star Wars (not my idea)
- Buttons for start, pause, speed, slow, and reset
- Animation continues smoothly even if you exit the app or change orientation.
